### Hi 👋, I'm Kevin Villota

I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first web page. The consolidated toolchain makes me want to stay and experiment with new technologies, like Reaact and Flask.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in full-stack web development, ideally writing Javascript or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!

- 🖥️ I've been coding in JavaScript primarily for over 3 years
- 🦕 I’m getting better at Java and C#
- 📚 Up next: Gearing up to study software analysis and development technology at Sena!
